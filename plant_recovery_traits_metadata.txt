taxon_name
    taxon names as they appear in AusTraits, i.e. names are aligned with the Australian Plant Census (see ausflora package
    to align names with APC)

resprouting_binomial
    TRUE or FALSE
    whether taxon has been recorded to resprout (or partially resprout) by more than 30% of sources; this is derived
    from the `resprouting_capacity` trait

seeding_binomial
    TRUE or FALSE
    whether taxon has been recorded as having post-fire recruitment by more than 30% of sources; this is derived from
    the `post_fire_recruitment` trait

min_maturity_primary
    minimum time to reproductive maturity (years) recorded by at least one source; this is derived from
    the `reproductive_maturity`, `fire_time_from_fire_to_flowering` and `fire_time_from_fire_to_fruiting` traits

avg_maturity_primary
    average time to reproductive maturity (years) recorded by at least one source; this is derived from
    the `reproductive_maturity`, `fire_time_from_fire_to_flowering` and `fire_time_from_fire_to_fruiting` traits

bin_maturity_primary
    time to reproductive maturity (years) recorded as a bin; this is derived from the `reproductive_maturity` trait

min_maturity_secondary
    maximum time to secondary reproductive maturity (years) recorded by at least one source (this is for species that
    survive a fire: the number of years post-disturbance required to resprout and re-reach reproductive maturity); this is
    derived from the `fire_time_from_fire_to_flowering` and `fire_time_from_fire_to_fruiting` traits

avg_maturity_secondary
    average time to secondary reproductive maturity (years) recorded by at least one source; this is
    derived from the `fire_time_from_fire_to_flowering` and `fire_time_from_fire_to_fruiting` traits
