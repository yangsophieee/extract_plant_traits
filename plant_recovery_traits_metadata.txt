resprouts
    TRUE or FALSE
    whether taxon has been recorded to resprout by at least one source

post_fire_seeder
    TRUE or FALSE
    whether taxon has been recorded as having post-fire recruitment by at least one source

no_signif_fire_response
    TRUE or FALSE
    whether taxon has been recorded as having 'no significant fire response' by at least 
    one source, meaning they are rarely killed by a moderate-intensity fire, but also do 
    not resprout

max_maturity
    maximum time to reproductive maturity (years) recorded by at least one source
    
min_maturity
    minimum time to reproductive maturity (years) recorded by at least one source

max_secondary_maturity
    maximum time to secondary reproductive maturity (years) recorded by at least one source
    (this is for species that survive a fire: the number of years post-disturbance required 
    to resprout and re-reach reproductive maturity)
    
min_secondary_maturity
    minimum time to secondary reproductive maturity (years) recorded by at least one source

est_secondary_maturity
    time to secondary reproductive maturity, value type (e.g. minimum, maximum) not specified
